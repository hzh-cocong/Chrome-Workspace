## Chrome-Workspace

A alfred workflow for the chrome extension of [savetabs](https://github.com/hzh-cocong/SaveTabs).

It can search the file like ***\*.tabs.html*** and create a new chrome browser window to open it.

It works like a workspace, so I named it a ***Chrome Workspace***.



## How to use?

Just input the keyword with ***tabs*** prefix like below.

## What is the ***\*.tabs.html***?

It is generate by a chrome extension that can save browser tab's url as a file so that you can open it again just like a workspace.
